I think the reason why information theory wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t formulated \
sooner, is because humans usually immediately project meaning on information, \
and because the space of all meaning is an endlessly complex space, it makes \
it seem that the messages themselves will not follow any laws. Shannon\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s insight, to ignore the meaning, and just look at the size \
of the message, is what allowed him to make progress in this area. Similarly \
for a theory of beauty, I think the reason why no theory exists,  is that \
when you consider the meaning behind images, things rapidly get impossibly \
complex. \

But just like information theory, I think progress can be made on the theory \
of beauty if we ignore the meaning and just look at the quantity of \
information that is needed to encode it. This is by no means my idea, \

It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s easier to start by defining uglyness. An example of \
something ugly, is an all black image. This image has a very low information \
quantity. So you may conclude that beauty increases with the quantity of \
information needed to describe an image. But it is not so simple, if we go \
the other way and just show someone complete random noise, while it may hold \
the eye for longer than the all-black image, nobody will travel across the \
world for to see something like this, like they will for natural landscapes \
or pieces of art. And you may say that this is because it has no meaning, but \
we actually have a counterexample to this, namely abstract art. Specifically \
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d like to focus on Jackson Pollock\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
work. His work is an excellent case study precisely because it has attracted \
so much attention, and has no inherent meaning. Now, studies have been done \
that show that his paintings are fractal, meaning the density paint scales \
with a power law. They are not just random squiggles as most people assume, \
Pollock, was very precise in how he put down the layers, and was going for a \
very specific look.  \

I believe that this idea, of images holding our eye because they make us feel \
like we can almost understand them is the exact same tactic that novelists \
use. The job of the author, is to inject enough randomness into the story to \
keep the reader off-balance and curious, but also give them enough to \
stability so that they feel as if they can answer there questions. As I \
mentioned, this is by no means my idea, and popular thinkers like Jordan \
Peterson and Nassim Taleb have this. With Peterson its order and chaos, with \
Taleb it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s antifragility.   \

What is the precise ratio? I do not think it is possible to collect enough \
data to come up with a precise ratio, for a level of uncertainty in images, \
or artwork. I do think it is possible to show that people who grew up in a \
more uncertain environment, will prefer more stable narratives, and people \
who grew up in a more stable environment will prefer more chaotic narratives. \
As we continue, the reason will make sense, but it lies in seeing us humans \
as agents under uncertainty. Pain and pleasure are our signals for how to \
navigate. When the environment has a lot of randomness, the direction you \
think you should proceed in is usually wrong, Therefore, the moment you \
experience the confusion, you will back away. \

Okay so I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m realizing I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not quite clear \
in what I mean by this. Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s try to get more specific. The \
idea is the following. A human is an agent. Okay so there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
a time preference and then there is the pain pleasure balance. But let\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s imagine each time you confuse the reader, they go down, \
away from the end goal. This means that they do not completely understand the \
story, and to figure it out they have to keep reading. If you do this too \
many times, they will assume that they will never \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]get \
the point\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of the story and stop reading. If you don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t do this enough then they assume they get the point and \
will also stop reading. Now my point here is that the amount that you confuse \
the reader depends on the readers tolerance for uncertainty. If they are very \
persistent, and willing to be confused, than you can confuse them a lot. And \
they will enjoy that because it means they are figuring things out. Now what \
does that say about the environment in which they were bred? I\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]m still not sure. \

But one interesting idea here is the notion that you will generally have to \
mimic your environment because that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s what the people are \
used to. In this sense, the phrase \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]art imitates life\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is very true. There is also multiple dimensions of \
decision making. One is the energy required figure things out, but there is \
also the time commitment.  But in general, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a question \
of how much cost will the agent endure before they leave. And it has to do \
also with the environment around them. \

Cell["\<\
Okay but in the case where you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re watching a movie. What \
really is the goal? Are you trying to get to the top of a hill? What is the \
role of the story in that case. Basically, the role of the story, is to make \
you continuously believe that there is some very important information that \
you must keep watching to obtain. They do this by basically having you \
befriend a character, and then put him in danger. Are \
brain\[CloseCurlyQuote]s gut reflex is then to watch the movie to \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]make sure\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] that they don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get harmed. So the job of the narrator, is to present the \
reader with problems that they care get solved. And just repeatedly do this. \
These need to be new problems though. Okay so if we imagine a narrative as a \
graph, you basically guide the reader through a graph. And along the way \
there are certain nodes with many different possibilities. Okay that kind of \
makes sense. So then the details of the graph would be the structure of the \
narrative. We can define each scene in the narrative as being a node. In a \
tarantino movie, each scene there are many potential ways that the story can \
go. Now the Christopher Nolan idea of having the reader be very confused for \
the entire movie, may be related to this but may also be the same idea. So \
how would a Christopher Nolan graph go. I mean maybe you could think of \
Christopher Nolan as the story takes many paths at once, and you are in many \
states at once. So maybe the nodes just correspond to states of the world. \
Then there is the number of potential current states, and that is kind of \
your current uncertainty, and there is also the branching effect. There\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s also another distinction you have to make, which is \
basically, let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s say you expect two different paths to \
happen, but then a third completely unexpected one occurs. So this would have \
to correspond to a different edge weight. Where there are actually many \
possible paths but you are convinced that okay the way you could resolve this \
is just say there are 100 paths and they are all converging to these two \
world states.   \

Okay but the problem with having one potential path, is that it doesn\

Okay so the job of the narrator is to present the graph, or the narrative, \
the agent has the option to continue into the graph or opt out. And the job \
of the artist is to convince you to travel through the graph. The artist has \
a set of edges that they can draw to a set of nodes. One of the things you \
can measure, is the number of edges over time. as you proceed through the \
graph. In a happily ever-after scenario, the number of edges converges to 0. \
But in a Christopher Nolan movie, the number of edges only diminishes and \
even at the end there are some edges pointing to nodes. Another critical \
factor is the length of the path that you take. Some stories are very long \
with many nodes, while others really just have a few nodes and focus on other \
aspects other than story telling. So when you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re looking at \
an image, it basically takes you along this path where you are looking at the \
image and the more you look at it, the paths are reducing. And like art, the \
number of edges is getting smaller as you see patterns and are able to \
predict what you will see next. Sometimes you are able to figure it out but \
other times, you are left to wonder. So the task is how to quantify this. \

Okay so my idea, is to have a set of nodes there are edges and then the \
placement. The placement corresponds to the perceived fitness and the edges \
correspond to where you can go from there. This could be pain and pleasure in \

this could be someone else\[CloseCurlyQuote]s pain and pleasure in a story, \
but ultimately all of them are about fitness. Well okay maybe you don\

some point far enough down, some threshold. This is human death, or utter \
failure, or extinction. Importantly, there is correlation with going up, but \
you can always descend. The difference between narratives in games, is you \
allow the user to decide. In narratives, the author decides. This was the \
